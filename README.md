The objective of this task was to develop an automated solution that reads data from a CSV file, analyzes it, and generates a professionally formatted PDF report. This kind of automation is useful in reducing manual work involved in data summarization and reporting, especially for recurring tasks in business, education, or research.
The task was broken down into three main steps:
Reading the data: The script begins by importing data from a CSV file. This file contains structured information, such as students' names, scores, and ages. The data is read into a pandas DataFrame which allows for easy manipulation and analysis.
Analyzing the data: Using the pandas library, the script performs basic statistical analysis. The describe() function is used to compute summary statistics, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and percentiles (25%, 50%, and 75%) for all numeric columns. For non-numeric columns like names, it shows the number of unique values, most frequent entry, and frequency count. This makes the analysis both quantitative and qualitative.
Generating the PDF report: The results of the analysis are formatted and exported as a PDF using the reportlab library. The report includes a title, a short description, and a stylized table displaying all the computed statistics. The table is customized with headers, background colors, text alignments, and grid lines for professional readability.
Tools and Libraries Used:
Python: The main programming language used for this task due to its readability and rich ecosystem.
pandas: For data reading, handling, and performing statistical analysis.
reportlab: To design and generate the PDF document with structured layout and formatting.
CSV file: Used as the input data source for analysis.
The task was performed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a lightweight yet powerful code editor with extensions for Python development.
This automated report generation task is highly applicable in real-world scenarios where regular reporting is needed. 
This task saves time, reduces human error, and ensures consistency in reporting. It's especially useful when working with large datasets or when reports must be generated periodically.
